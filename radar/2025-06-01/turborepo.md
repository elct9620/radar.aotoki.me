While Turborepo is a powerful monorepo tool, we've found it to be too complex for our current needs. We're using pnpm workspace instead, which provides sufficient monorepo functionality with a simpler configuration and learning curve. Existing projects using Turborepo can continue to do so, but we recommend evaluating pnpm workspace for new projects.
